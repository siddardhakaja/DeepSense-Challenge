# DeepSense-Challenge
Human Dectection using Faster R-CNN ResNet

This program is designed and created as a part of DeepSense ocean data challenge. 

The problem is to identify a human that fell off a ship or a ferry into the water. Due to the short time availablity, around 284 images in the internet are scraped considering different scenarios. A machine learning model is compiled using Faster R-CNN-ResNet due to its flexibility and reliability on object detection. 

The images for training and testing are available here in this drive link
